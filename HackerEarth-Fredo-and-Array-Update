HackerEarth-Fredo-and-Array-Update
Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x , that is, ; such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format: First line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A. Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format: The only line of output consists of the value of x.

Input Constraints:

SAMPLE INPUT 5 1 2 3 4 5 SAMPLE OUTPUT 4 Explanation Initial sum of array When we update all elements to 4, sum of array which is greater than . Note that if we had updated the array elements to 3, which is not greater than . So, 4 is the minimum value to which array elements need to be updated.
